Hello! 

I finally managed to find the time for setting up some (very simple) blog.
In fact, I have stealed the code from [Mojombo](https://github.com/YoungD3v/mojombo.github.io)
hope he won't mind. 

Writings are mine own, if not stated otherwise. 

This is also the first post about mine progress through #Devember, so here goes the Contract:

I, **Young D3v**, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be **framework for Game Theory and Games**. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

I will code (probably in Java for its speed, haven't decided yet) framework for testing concepts of Game theory,
trying different algorithms for strategies computations etc. The core will be (hopefully) lightweight code, connecting games (Poker, Chess, etc.), 
with algorithms (CFR, MaxMin, MCTS, ANN) and with testing environment tournaments, expected game values, etc. 

## Progress

Today I spent most of the time setting up this pages. Created GitHub [repo](https://github.com/YoungD3v/GTFramework) and prepared all necessary stuff in IDE. Just boring stuff. 
Also give some thoughts to the architecture with pen and paper.

Besides this GT framework I am doing [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017), cause challenging collegues from work is awesome. 

You can follow me/contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YoungD3v). 

Happy winter coding!
