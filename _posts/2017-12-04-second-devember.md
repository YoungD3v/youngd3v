Ola! 

I did more meditation on architecture and how to build the framework, so I spent most of the weekdn with the pen and paper, drawing how it all should work together. 

The framework will contain domains connected with algorithms and accompanied with terounaments and other means of evaluation. Games from the point of the Game theory can be divided by many features, I will mostly focus on sequence form games. Some (e. g. prisoners dilemma) I will do as normal form game. I have to deal with imperfect information and similar stuff, but this I delayed and hope for the good possible solution when the time comes. 

There are also difficulties, with approaches from Game theory aspects and Reinforcement learning aspects. GT usually wants to play with the full tree and RL uses "blind" interaction with the game. The framework will most definitely reflect this. 

I managed to do next Advent of Code challenge, the 3rd day. I didn't want to code the first part, so I did it analyticaly, but second part wasn't that easy, so I hacked quick solution for it.
