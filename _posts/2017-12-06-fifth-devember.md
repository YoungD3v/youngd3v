<p class="meta">6 December 2017</p>

Roadmap for the few next day is set as well as the first steps towards the goal of this week -> to have implemented Tic-Tac-Toe, with interfaces for RL as well as some exact algorithms from Game theory. 

TTT needs the implementation of payoff calculations, game state class, some game tree expander, simple algs (MinMax and something for MDPs). After that, I need to build the last part (roughly), the tournaments/strategy tests. After this, one round of refactoring, abstracting, building the framework parts and setting up tests. 

This should be done by the end of the week, and I'll plan the next "sprint" during weekend according to what needs to be done in the infrastructure part. 

Note: Somewhere during the weekend I plan to head off-road and do some bug fixing in the open-source repositories, which I would like to use/recommend, but can't because of the few bugs. 

Perseverance is the best trait of all.
