<p class="meta">4 December 2017</p>

Next day of the Devember. Next day of some extra coding besides normal work rhythm.

Today I put aside the architecture notes and sketches and tried to prototype TicTacToe domain, to see what will be needed and what the architecture should have. Not yet sure how to build it, but the way through prototyping seems nice and feasible. 

Tomorrow plan is to finish TTT for reinforcement learning algorithms as well as algorithms searching through the complete game tree. I will implement some simple algorithm after finishing TTT as part of prototyping and exploring how to build the framework.

Is funny to code in Java, while most of the day I spend with Python. It's sometimes confusing. 

Keep it up!
